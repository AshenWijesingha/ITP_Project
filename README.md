#### Brief Description of Project : 
This project primarily focused on the management of Customers, Patients, Surgeons,
Designs, Payments and the Staff Members with accurate and concurrently and this system
helps to manage their day today activities easily without irritating. Also, this system helps
with newly designed sub systems and innovative parts with so many easy-to-use
interfaces and user guidelines. In this project our objective is to uplift their day today
paperwork and shift those methods and procedures to a computer-based web application,
who can use this any ware at any time with authentication and authorization processes.
So, this system is more secure and more accurate than humanoid workflows.

#### Technologies used :
We used UML apparatuses and strategies in our information technology project, as well as a
database modeling tool such as MongoDB and a project management software such as MS
Project. We have divided our work into sections and are working on it independently. We used
Draw.io, StarUML, and Mockflow to create the illustrations and models for our projects. As a
result, one and each colleague fulfilled their respective commitments. Model one part used
Microsoft PowerPoint to create the task proposition presentation, and it is also used to create the
scrum presentation in the second model. In order to complete our task proposition record, we
used Microsoft Word. Consequently, the Microsoft office package has proven to be extremely
beneficial in helping us complete our project proposal planning and finish our sanction archive.
Each colleague independently depicted their capability in Microsoft Word, and then they all
combined their work into a unified word archive.

The Adobe XD design software is used to ensure that the design is clear and effective. When it
comes to designing interfaces for websites or apps, Adobe XD is a powerful vector program that
was created specifically for those who want to be productive and creative at the same time.
Draw.io is a valuable free outlining administration that offers strong collaboration features to its
users. It has several different shape libraries, each of which contains hundreds of visual
components. In this section, we can create and share graphs directly from within an internet
browser. As a result, we were able to use it to create our framework outline chart. Aside from
that, we've made use of StarUML as well. It is a collection of language-display apparatuses that
have been brought together. It is also employed in the creation of UML diagrams. A hackolade
will also be used as the database displaying apparatus for our database, in addition to the rest of
the equipment. (MongoDB) These are the tools and technological advancements that we have
made use of. As part of our executive project management process, we used the Microsoft
Project/MS Project software.

We will make use of a variety of resources in order to complete our project on time and budget.
As a programming language, we will use JavaScript and Node.js to accomplish our goals. It is a
JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code that is not contained
within a web browser. This environment is completely based on the JavaScript engine in version
8. Nodejs offers a genuine opportunity to build high-performance web applications from the
ground up. Visual Studio Code and Eclipse will serve as our primary integrated development
environments, with Sublime Text serving as our secondary editor.

In addition, we will use React as the front-end framework and Express as the back-end
framework for our application. Express is a NodeJS web application framework that adds
features to web and multi-platform applications while maintaining simplicity. It provides a
rationale for worker-side applications on the web and in portable devices. Combined with the
MongoDB data store, Express serves as the backend component of the MERN stack, while react
serves as the frontend framework. React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces that is
both effective and adaptable. It creates complex user interfaces out of small and discrete pieces
of code known as "components." It is used to put together single-page applications on the web.

Bootstrap, HTML, and XML will be the web technologies that we will be utilizing for our ITP
project. Bootstrap is a well-known CSS structure that, in addition, allows for the incorporation of
JavaScript augmentations. It incorporates plan layouts that are based on HTML and CSS. In
addition, we use XML to display information on our website. It has the potential to be used for
both frontend and backend purposes in a single application. We will make use of Apache as the
web service and Apache Tomcat as the webserver in this implementation. Apache is a web server
that is free and open-source software that distributes web content over the internet. It is the
Apache's responsibility to establish a connection between the Apache tomcat worker and the web
browsers of web application guests in this situation. Apache is a multi-stage programming
language. Apache tomcat worker is a servlet compartment that can serve java servlet demands
